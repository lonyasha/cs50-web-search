# Search

Search is a front-end web application created as part of **[CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/)** course offered by Harvard University. This project replicates and extends Googleâ€™s search functionality, allowing users to perform regular, image, and advanced searches with a custom interface styled to resemble Googleâ€™s aesthetics.

## About the Project

This web application includes three main pages:

1. **Google Search**:
   - A search bar where users can type queries and be directed to Google's search results.
   - Includes a link to **Image Search** and **Advanced Search** in the upper-right corner.
   - The "I'm Feeling Lucky" button, when clicked, redirects users to the first Google search result.

2. **Google Image Search**:
   - Allows users to search for images on Google by typing a query.
   - Includes a link to go back to the **Google Search** page.

3. **Google Advanced Search**:
   - Provides input fields for advanced search criteria:
     - Find pages with "all these words".
     - Find pages with "this exact word or phrase".
     - Find pages with "any of these words".
     - Find pages with "none of these words".
   - Includes a link to return to the **Google Search** page.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout is optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.
- **Minimalistic User Interface**: Inspired by Googleâ€™s clean and user-friendly design.
- **Navigation**: Simple navigation between Google Search, Google Image Search, and Google Advanced Search pages.
- **"I'm Feeling Lucky"**: A button on the Google Search page that directs users straight to the first search result.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For the structure of the pages and forms.
- **CSS**: For styling the layout and making the interface visually appealing, closely resembling Google's aesthetic.
- **GET Parameters**: Used to pass search queries in the URL to replicate Googleâ€™s search functionality.
